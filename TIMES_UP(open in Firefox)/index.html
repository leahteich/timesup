  <h2>By Cleo De Rocco, Cindy Hou, Mia Schiff, Leah Teichholtz for HackTrinV</h2>
  <p>"Powered by women, TIMEâ€™S UP addresses the systemic inequality and injustice in the workplace that have kept underrepresented groups from reaching their full potential."

  <p>As the Times Up movement sweeps the nation, more and more people are becoming aware of the problems of sexual harrassment in the workplace.</p>

  <p>To help spread awareness to this problem, we have created a simulation of a woman's workday. Our character, Annie, encounters many different types of harrassment at work. We believe this simulation holds true to the experience of many women across the country. </p>

 <p>We hope that this simulation both educates people on the facts of harrassment in the workplace and creates awareness of this ever-present problem and the different ways it can manifest itself.</p>
